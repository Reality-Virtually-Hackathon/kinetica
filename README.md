# kinetica

Pioneering the future of fitness through social virtual reality.

Kinetica gamifies different aspects of fitness within a virtual, social context.  Individuals can exercise alone, with many others, and with a specialist (trainer, therapist, clinician).  Our Hackathon build allows for two people to enter into a beautiful environment where one user(the Trainer) guides the other user (Trainee) through different body movements.  These movements could be traditional workout moves (arm raises, curls, squats), sports-specific mechanics(golf swing, yoga, karate maneuvers), dance moves, or physical therapy exercises to promote targeted mobility.  The Microsoft Kinect allows for non-intrusive full body tracking with high accuracy and low latency, allowing the user to see a direct overlay of the trainer along with multiple perspectives of themselves.
